## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyber Security Project for Message Encryption and Decryption. This project provides a set of tools for encrypting and decrypting messages, ensuring secure communication. The goal is to offer a robust and user-friendly implementation of encryption algorithms suitable for various applications.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Securely encrypt messages using strong encryption algorithms.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the provided encryption tools.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms**: Includes support for several encryption algorithms such as AES, RSA, and more.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated into existing projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyber-security-encryption-decryption.git
    cd cyber-security-encryption-decryption
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Encrypting a Message

To encrypt a message, use the following command:

```bash
python encrypt.py --algorithm AES --key yourkey --message "Your secret message"
```

- `--algorithm`: The encryption algorithm to use (e.g., AES, RSA).
- `--key`: The encryption key.
- `--message`: The message to encrypt.

### Decrypting a Message

To decrypt a message, use the following command:

```bash
python decrypt.py --algorithm AES --key yourkey --encrypted-message "EncryptedMessage"
```

- `--algorithm`: The encryption algorithm used for encryption (e.g., AES, RSA).
- `--key`: The encryption key.
- `--encrypted-message`: The encrypted message to decrypt.

## Configuration

The project can be configured using a configuration file (`config.json`). Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "default_algorithm": "AES",
  "key_length": 256
}
```

- `default_algorithm`: The default encryption algorithm.
- `key_length`: The length of the encryption key.
